Welcome to my digital workspace!

I'm a **data analyst** passionate about turning messy data into insightful stories. My work blends **statistics**, **machine learning**, and **visual storytelling** to address real-world problems.

I come from a strong background in **mathematics and education**, with over a decade spent making complex concepts make sense. These days, I channel that clarity into crafting analytical solutions and writing articles that simplify mathematical topics.
